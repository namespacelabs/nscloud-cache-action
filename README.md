# High-performance caching on Namespace

Enable your GitHub jobs to cache dependencies and build outputs across invocations, with Namespace's cache volumes.

With Namespace caching, there are no "upload" and no "download" cache phases; your caches are made available transparently, without a performance penalty. They're still backed by high-performance NVMe storage.


## Prerequisites

In order to use `nscloud-cache-action`, you need to ensure that caching is enabled on your job -- e.g. that a cache volume is attached to the GitHub Actions job.

Check out the [Cache Volumes guide](https://namespace.so/docs/features/faster-github-actions#using-a-cache-volume) for an example of how to enable caching.

## Example

Select which frameworks you'd like to cache.

You can find a list of supported frameworks at [namespace.so/docs/actions/nscloud-cache-action#cache](https://namespace.so/docs/actions/nscloud-cache-action#cache).

```yaml
name: Tests
jobs:
  tests:
    runs-on: namespace-profile-my-profile-with-caching
 
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
 
      - name: Install Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v6
        with:
          cache: false # Skip remote GitHub caching
 
      - name: Set up Go cache
        uses: namespacelabs/nscloud-cache-action@v1
        with:
          cache: go
 
      - name: Go tests
        run: go test ./...
```

Alternatively, or in addition, you can select a list of paths to cache:

```yaml
      - name: Set up Go cache
        uses: namespacelabs/nscloud-cache-action@v1
        with:
          path: |
            /home/runner/.cache/go-build
            /home/runner/go/pkg/mod
```
